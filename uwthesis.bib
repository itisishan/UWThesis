abstract = {Sound source localization is paramount for comfort of life, determining the position of a sound source in 3 dimensions: azimuth, height and distance. It is based on 3 types of cue: 2 binaural (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) and 1 monaural spectral cue (head-related transfer function). These are complementary and vary according to the acoustic characteristics of the incident sound. The objective of this report is to update the current state of knowledge on the physical basis of spatial sound localization.}

title = "Speech enhancement by online non-negative spectrogram decomposition in non-stationary noise environments",
abstract = "Classical single-channel speech enhancement algorithms have two convenient properties: they require pre-learning the noise model but not the speech model, and they work online. However, they often have difficulties in dealing with non-stationary noise sources. Source separation algorithms based on nonnegative spectrogram decompositions are capable of dealing with non-stationary noise, but do not possess the aforementioned properties. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of both classical algorithms and non-negative spectrogram decomposition algorithms. Experiments show that it significantly outperforms four categories of classical algorithms in non-stationary noise environments.",

The proposed framework is based on Long Short-Term Memory LSTM RNNs which are discriminatively trained according to an optimal speech reconstruction objective. We demonstrate that LSTM speech enhancement, even when used 'na\"{\i}vely' as front-end processing, delivers competitive results on the CHiME-2 speech recognition task. Furthermore, simple, feature-level fusion based extensions to the framework are proposed to improve the integration with the ASR back-end. These yield a best result of 13.76\"{\i} undefined% average word error rate, which is, to our knowledge, the best score to date.},

abstract = {This paper finds that actions of the teeth, namely tapping and sliding, produce vibrations in the jaw and skull. These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.},

abstract = {Frequent blood pressure monitoring is the key to diagnosis and treatments of many severe diseases. However, the conventional ambulatory methods require patients to carry a blood pressure (BP) monitoring device for 24 h and conduct the measurement every 10--15 min. Despite their extensive usage, wearing the wrist/arm-based BP monitoring device for a long time has a significant impact on users' daily activities. To address the problem, we developed eBP to measure blood pressure (BP) from inside user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities although maximizing its comfort level.The key novelty of eBP includes (1) a light-based inflatable pulse sensor which goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) BP estimation algorithms that eliminate the need of blocking the blood flow inside the ear.Through the comparative study of 35 subjects, eBP can achieve the average error of 1.8 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and -3.1 mmHg for diastolic (low-pressure value) with the standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg, respectively. These results satisfy the FDA's AAMI standard, which requires a mean error of less than 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of less than 8 mmHg.},

abstract = {Sound source localization is paramount for comfort of life, determining the position of a sound source in 3 dimensions: azimuth, height and distance. It is based on 3 types of cue: 2 binaural (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) and 1 monaural spectral cue (head-related transfer function). These are complementary and vary according to the acoustic characteristics of the incident sound. The objective of this report is to update the current state of knowledge on the physical basis of spatial sound localization.}
