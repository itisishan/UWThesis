abstract = {Sound source localization is paramount for comfort of life, determining the position of a sound source in 3 dimensions: azimuth, height and distance. It is based on 3 types of cue: 2 binaural (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) and 1 monaural spectral cue (head-related transfer function). These are complementary and vary according to the acoustic characteristics of the incident sound. The objective of this report is to update the current state of knowledge on the physical basis of spatial sound localization.}

title = "Speech enhancement by online non-negative spectrogram decomposition in non-stationary noise environments",
abstract = "Classical single-channel speech enhancement algorithms have two convenient properties: they require pre-learning the noise model but not the speech model, and they work online. However, they often have difficulties in dealing with non-stationary noise sources. Source separation algorithms based on nonnegative spectrogram decompositions are capable of dealing with non-stationary noise, but do not possess the aforementioned properties. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of both classical algorithms and non-negative spectrogram decomposition algorithms. Experiments show that it significantly outperforms four categories of classical algorithms in non-stationary noise environments.",

The proposed framework is based on Long Short-Term Memory LSTM RNNs which are discriminatively trained according to an optimal speech reconstruction objective. We demonstrate that LSTM speech enhancement, even when used 'na\"{\i}vely' as front-end processing, delivers competitive results on the CHiME-2 speech recognition task. Furthermore, simple, feature-level fusion based extensions to the framework are proposed to improve the integration with the ASR back-end. These yield a best result of 13.76\"{\i} undefined average word error rate, which is, to our knowledge, the best score to date.},

abstract = {This paper finds that actions of the teeth, namely tapping and sliding, produce vibrations in the jaw and skull. These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.},

abstract = {Frequent blood pressure monitoring is the key to diagnosis and treatments of many severe diseases. However, the conventional ambulatory methods require patients to carry a blood pressure (BP) monitoring device for 24 h and conduct the measurement every 10--15 min. Despite their extensive usage, wearing the wrist/arm-based BP monitoring device for a long time has a significant impact on users' daily activities. To address the problem, we developed eBP to measure blood pressure (BP) from inside user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities although maximizing its comfort level.The key novelty of eBP includes (1) a light-based inflatable pulse sensor which goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) BP estimation algorithms that eliminate the need of blocking the blood flow inside the ear.Through the comparative study of 35 subjects, eBP can achieve the average error of 1.8 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and -3.1 mmHg for diastolic (low-pressure value) with the standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg, respectively. These results satisfy the FDA's AAMI standard, which requires a mean error of less than 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of less than 8 mmHg.},

abstract = {Sound source localization is paramount for comfort of life, determining the position of a sound source in 3 dimensions: azimuth, height and distance. It is based on 3 types of cue: 2 binaural (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) and 1 monaural spectral cue (head-related transfer function). These are complementary and vary according to the acoustic characteristics of the incident sound. The objective of this report is to update the current state of knowledge on the physical basis of spatial sound localization.}

This koan has long served as an aid to meditation but it also describes our new interaction techinique. We discovered that gentle fingertip gestures such as tapping, rubbing, and flicking make quiet sounds that travel by bone conduction throughout the hand. A small wristband-mounted contact microphone can reliably and inexpensively sense these sounds. We harnessed this "sound in the hand" phenomenon to build a wristband-mounted bio-acoustic fingertip gesture interface. The bio-acoustic interface recognizes some common gestures that state-of-the-art glove and image-processing techniques capture but in a smaller, mobile package.},

In the learning phase, our method constructs a regression model by using the data on hand posture captured by a depth camera and data on the skin deformation of the back of the hand captured by several photo-reflective sensors. In the estimation phase, by using this regression model, the posture of the hand is reconstructed from the data of the photo-reflective sensors in real-time. The posture of fingers can be estimated without hindering the natural movement of the fingers since the deformation of the back of the hand is measured without directly measuring the position of the fingers. This method can be used by users to manipulate information in a virtual environment with their fingers. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of reconstructing hand posture with the proposed system.},

We propose an index-finger-worn device that consists of a short-range (~2cm) RFID reader and a pair of two inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are mounted at the locations where an artificial nail and a ring are worn. The short-range RFID reader recognizes the tagged object on finger touch, and then the IMU data are used for activity recognition. Data collected from the user of this device allows for a post-hoc analysis, which informs the activity recognition performance in various RFID+IMU and IMU-only configurations on the same task. The results of a ten-participant user study show that when the objects have similar physical form factors, the hybrid RFID motion tracking significantly outperforms the IMU-only tracking, especially in a larger-number set of objects. In our test, three IMU configurations (i.e., NailOnly, RingOnly, and Nail+Ring) achieved comparable action recognition performances, i.e., \geq{}90\% accuracy, with 500 ms recognition time, though the NailOnly RFID+IMU configuration provided the highest wearability. The practical challenges toward a real-world deployment of a finger-worn RFID motion tracking system are also discussed.},

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility, accuracy, and robustness of recognizing the uninstrumented object in a user's hand by sensing and decoding her forearm muscular activities via off-the-shelf electromyography (EMG) sensors. We present results from three studies to advance our fundamental understanding of the opportunities that EMG brings in object interaction recognition. In the first study, we investigated the influence of physical properties of objects such as shape, size, and weight on EMG signals. We also conducted a thorough exploration of the feature spaces and sensor positions which can provide a solid base to rely on for future designers and practitioners for such interactive technique. In the second study, we assessed the feasibility and accuracy of inferring the types of grasped objects via using forearm muscular activity as a cue. Our results indicate that the types of objects can be recognized with up to 94.2\% accuracy by employing user-dependent training. In the third study, we investigated the robustness of this approach in a realistic office setting where users were allowed to interact with objects as they would naturally. Our approach achieved up to 82.5\% accuracy in discriminating 15 types of objects, even when training and testing phrases were purposefully performed on different days to incorporate changes in EMG patterns over time. Overall, this work contributes a set of fundamental findings and guidelines on using EMG technologies for object-based activity tracking.},

We wrapped these sensing capabilities into a proof-of-concept end-to-end system, Ubiquitous Controls, that enables virtual range inputs by sensing continuous interactions with unaugmented objects. Eight users leveraged our system to control UI widgets (like sliders and dials) with object interactions (like ``cutting with scissors'' and ``squeezing a ball''). Finally, we discuss the implications and opportunities of using hands as a ubiquitous sensor of our surroundings.},

We envision this paradigm to be generalizable for all objects regardless of whether they are acoustically or electromagnetically active, and that it detects different motions while holding the same object. Our proof-of-concept setup consists of six IMU sensors mounted on the fingers and back of the hand. Our experiments show that when the posture is combined with the motion, the personalized object-activity detection accuracy increases from 80\% to 87\%.},

	abstract     = {Smartwatches and wearables are unique in that they reside on the body, presenting great potential for always-available input and interaction. Their position on the wrist makes them ideal for capturing bio-acoustic signals. We developed a custom smartwatch kernel that boosts the sampling rate of a smartwatch's existing accelerometer to 4 kHz. Using this new source of high-fidelity data, we uncovered a wide range of applications. For example, we can use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks, claps, scratches, and taps, which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities. Bio-acoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects, enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-aware functionality. Finally, we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer, and show that data can be transmitted through the human body. Overall, our contributions unlock user interface techniques that previously relied on special-purpose and/or cumbersome instrumentation, making such interactions considerably more feasible for inclusion in future consumer devices.},

VibEye triggers a vibration from one finger, and the vibration that has propagated through the object is sensed at the other finger. This vibration includes information about the object's identity, and we represent it using a spectrogram. Collecting the spectrograms of many objects, we formulate the object recognition problem to a classical classification problem among the images. This simple method, when tested with 20 users, shows 92.5\% accuracy for 16 objects of the same shape with various materials. This material-based classifier is also extended to the recognition of everyday objects. Lastly, we demonstrate several tangible applications where VibEye provides the needed functionality while enhancing user experiences. VibEye is particularly effective for recognizing objects made of different materials, which is difficult to distinguish by other means such as light and sound.},

By modifying a small, low-cost, software-defined radio, we can detect and classify these signals in real-time, enabling robust on-touch object detection. Unlike prior work, our approach requires no instrumentation of objects or the environment; our sensor is self-contained and can be worn unobtrusively on the body. We call our technique EM-Sense and built a proof-of-concept smartwatch implementation. Our studies show that discrimination between dozens of objects is feasible, independent of wearer, time and local environment.},

Recently, sensing the usage of home electrical devices has emerged as a promising area for activity recognition studies because we can estimate high-level daily activities by recognizing the use of electrical devices that exist ubiquitously in our daily lives. A feature of our approach is that we can recognize the use of electrical devices that are not connected to the home infrastructure without the need to equip them with sensors. We evaluated the performance of our approach by using sensor data obtained from real houses. We also investigated the portability of training data between different users.},

We tested different ring wearing positions and tapping postures (e.g., with different fingers and parts). Results show that an IMU-based ring worn on the proximal phalanx of the index finger can accurately sense touch contact of most usable tapping postures. Partici\-pants preferred wearing a ring for better user experience. Our approach can be used in combination with the optical touch sensing to provide robust and low-latency contact detection.},

Notably, LightRing tracks subtle fingertip movements from the finger base without requiring instrumentation of other body parts or the environment. This keeps the normal hand function intact and allows for a socially acceptable appearance. We evaluate LightRing in a 2d pointing experiment in two scenarios: on a desk while sitting down, and on the leg while standing.

	abstract     = {Previous work has demonstrated the viability of applying offline analysis to interpret forearm electromyography (EMG) and classify finger gestures on a physical surface. We extend those results to bring us closer to using muscle-computer interfaces for always-available input in real-world applications. We leverage existing taxonomies of natural human grips to develop a gesture set covering interaction in free space even when hands are busy with other objects. We present a system that classifies these gestures in real-time and we introduce a bi-manual paradigm that enables use in interactive systems. We report experimental results demonstrating four-finger classification accuracies averaging 79\% for pinching, 85\% while holding a travel mug, and 88\% when carrying a weighted bag. We further show generalizability across different arm postures and explore the tradeoffs of providing real-time visual feedback.},

	abstract     = {EtherPose is a continuous hand pose tracking system employing two wrist-worn antennas, from which we measure the real-time dielectric loading resulting from different hand geometries (i.e., poses). Unlike worn camera-based methods, our RF approach is more robust to occlusion from clothing and avoids capturing potentially sensitive imagery. Through a series of simulations and empirical studies, we designed a proof-of-concept, worn implementation built around compact vector network analyzers. Sensor data is then interpreted by a machine learning backend, which outputs a fully-posed 3D hand. In a user study, we show how our system can track hand pose with a mean Euclidean joint error of 11.6 mm, even when covered in fabric. We also studied 2DOF wrist angle and micro-gesture tracking. In the future, our approach could be miniaturized and extended to include more and different types of antennas, operating at different self resonances.},

In this work, we introduce AuraSense, which enables rich, around-device, smartwatch interactions using electric field sensing as an adapted device. To explore how this sensing approach could enhance smartwatch interactions, we considered different antenna configurations and how they could enable useful interaction modalities. We identified four configurations that can support six well-known modalities of particular interest and utility, including gestures above or in close proximity to watches, and touchscreen-like finger tracking on the skin. We quantify the feasibility of these input modalities, suggesting that AuraSense can be low latency and robust across users and environments.},

We present PeriSense, a ring-shaped interaction device enabling multi-finger gesture interaction. Gestures of the finger wearing ring and its adjacent fingers are sensed by measuring capacitive proximity between electrodes and human skin. Our main contribution is the determination of PeriSenses interaction space involving the evaluation of capabilities and limitations. We introduce a prototype named PeriSense, analyze the sensor resolution at different distances, and evaluate finger gestures and unistroke gestures based on gesture sets allowing the determination of the strengths and limitations. We show that PeriSense is able to sense the change of conductive objects reliably up to 2.5 cm. Furthermore, we show that this capability enables different interaction techniques such as multi-finger gesture recognition or two-handed unistroke input.}

Capacitive sensing has become ubiquitous on mobile, wearable, and stationary devices - enabling fundamentally new interaction techniques on, above, and around them. The research community has also enabled human position estimation and whole-body gestural interaction in instrumented environments. However, the broad field of capacitive sensing research has become fragmented by different approaches and terminology used across the various domains. This paper strives to unify the field by advocating consistent terminology and proposing a new taxonomy to classify capacitive sensing approaches. Our extensive survey provides an analysis and review of past research and identifies challenges for future work. We aim to create a common understanding within the field of human-computer interaction, for researchers and practitioners alike, and to stimulate and facilitate future research in capacitive sensing.},

abstract = {As we are surrounded by an ever-larger variety of post-PC devices, the traditional methods for identifying and authenticating users have become cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a capacitive communication method through which a device can recognize who is interacting with it. This method exploits the capacitive touchscreens, which are now used in laptops, phones, and tablets, as a signal receiver. The signal that identifies the user can be generated by a small transmitter embedded into a ring, watch, or other artifact carried on the human body. We explore two example system designs with a low-power continuous transmitter that communicates through the skin and a signet ring that needs to be touched to the screen. Experiments with our prototype transmitter and tablet receiver show that capacitive communication through a touchscreen is possible, even without hardware or firmware modifications on a receiver. This latter approach imposes severe limits on the data rate, but the rate is sufficient for differentiating users in multiplayer tablet games or parental control applications. Controlled experiments with a signal generator also indicate that future designs may be able to achieve datarates that are useful for providing less obtrusive authentication with similar assurance as PIN codes or swipe patterns commonly used on smartphones today.},

It consists of a ring, which emits a continuous high frequency AC signal, and a sensing wristband with multiple electrodes. Due to the phase delay inherent in a high-frequency AC signal propagating through the body, a phase difference can be observed between pairs of electrodes. SkinTrack measures these phase differences to compute a 2D finger touch coordinate. Our approach can segment touch events at 99\% accuracy, and resolve the 2D location of touches with a mean error of 7.6mm. As our approach is compact, non-invasive, low-cost and low-powered, we envision the technology being integrated into future smartwatches, supporting rich touch interactions beyond the confines of the small touchscreen.},

Real-time speech enhancement for wireless earbuds requires high-quality sound separation and background cancellation, operating in real-time and on a mobile phone. Clear-Buds bridges state-of-the-art deep learning for blind audio source separation and in-ear mobile systems by making two key technical contributions: 1) a new wireless earbud design capable of operating as a synchronized, binaural microphone array, and 2) a lightweight dual-channel speech enhancement neural network that runs on a mobile device. Our neural network has a novel cascaded architecture that combines a time-domain conventional neural network with a spectrogram-based frequency masking neural network to reduce the artifacts in the audio output. Results show that our wireless earbuds achieve a synchronization error less than 64 μs and our network has a runtime of 21.4 ms on an accompanying mobile phone. In-the-wild evaluation with eight users in previously unseen indoor and outdoor multipath scenarios demonstrates that our neural network generalizes to learn both spatial and acoustic cues to perform noise suppression and background speech removal. In a user-study with 37 participants who spent over 15.4 hours rating 1041 audio samples collected in-the-wild, our system achieves improved mean opinion score and background noise suppression.System demo video: https://youtu.be/HYu0ybjcQPA},

  abstract  = "The study of sensorimotor or practical intelligence in the first
               two years of development has taught us how the child, at first
               directly assimilating the external environment to his own
               activity, later, in order to extend this assimilation, forms an
               increasing number of schemata which are both more mobile and
               better able to intercoordinate. Side by side with this
               progressive involvement of the assimilatory schemata runs the
               continuous elaboration of the external universe, in other words,
               the convergent development of the explicatory function. It is
               apparent that a development of explicatory accommodation
               corresponds to the progress of implicatory assimilation. The
               increasing coherence of the schemata thus parallels the
               formation of a world of objects and spatial relationships, in
               short, the elaboration of a solid and permanent universe. We
               must study the second aspect of the evolution of sensorimotor
               intelligence. This new phase of mental development is of course
               inseparable from the first, object and causality are nothing
               other than accommodation to the reality of the schematism of
               assimilation. It is justifiable to study these phases
               separately, for the description of behavior no longer suffices
               to account for these new products of intellectual activity; it
               is the subject's own interpretation of things which we must now
               try to analyze. The symmetry between the representation of
               things and the functional development of intelligence enables us
               from now on to glimpse the directional line of the evolution of
               the concepts of object, space, causality, and time. This
               organization of reality occurs, as we shall see, to the extent
               that the self is freed from itself by finding itself and so
               assigns itself a place as a thing among things, an event among
               events. The transition from chaos to cosmos, which we shall
               study in the perception and representation of the world in the
               first two years of life, is brought about through an elimination
               of egocentrism comparable to that which we have described on the
               plane of the child's reflective thought and logic. But it is in
               its elementary and primordial form that we shall now try to
               grasp this component process of understanding; we shall thus
               comprehend how it depends on the mechanism of intellectual
               assimilation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

The retinal image of the real objects which we see is, after all, only two-dimensional. Thus if we can place suitable two-dimensional images on the observer's retinas, we can create the illusion that he is seeing a three-dimensional object. Although stereo presentation is important to the three-dimensional illusion, it is less important than the change that takes place in the image when the observer moves his head. The image presented by the three-dimensional display must change in exactly the way that the image of a real object would change for similar motions of the user's head. Psychologists have long known that moving perspective images appear strikingly three-dimensional even without stereo presentation; the three-dimensional display described in this paper depends heavily on this "kinetic depth effect."},

Although this binaural‐monaural difference does not vary as a function of frequency when pure‐tone thresholds are measured in the quiet, the difference does vary with frequency when pure tones are presented against a background of noise. Binaural summation, a term which has been used in the past to refer to the phenomenon in which the binaural threshold is lower than the monaural, obtains for masked thresholds only when the phase angles between the the two earphones are opposite for the tones and the noise. If the tones and the noise have the same interaural phase angle the binaural threshold is higher than the monaural. This phenomenon, called interaural inhibition, as well as its antipode, interaural summation, is most marked at low frequencies and increases as the intensity of the masking noise is increased. The discussion considers some implications of these findings for the theory of masking and of interaural summation.}",

abstract = {Spatial User Interfaces, such as wearable fitness trackers are widely used to monitor and improve athletic performance. However, most fitness tracker interfaces require bimanual interactions, which significantly impacts the user's gait and pace. This paper evaluated a one-handed thumb-to-ring gesture interface to quickly access information without interfering with physical activity, such as running. By a pilot study, the most minimal gesture set was selected, particularly those that could be executed reflexively to minimize distraction and cognitive load. The evaluation revealed that among the selected gestures, the tap, swipe-down, and swipe-left were the most 'easy to use'. Interestingly, motion does not have a significant effect on the ease of use or on the execution time. However, interacting in motion was subjectively rated as more demanding. Finally, the gesture set was evaluated in real-world applications, while the user performed a running exercise and simultaneously controlled a lap timer, a distance counter, and a music player.},
